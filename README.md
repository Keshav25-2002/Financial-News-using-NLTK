# Financial-News-using-NLTK

This project aims to analyze financial news articles and classify them as positive, negative or neutral using Natural Language Processing techniques and the NLTK 

library.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of financial news articles collected from various sources. The dataset contains a total of 4846 observations.

Model

The financial news classification model is built using Python, and the model is built using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The project is divided into 

two parts: data preprocessing and modeling. In the data preprocessing part, the dataset is preprocessed and transformed into the required format for the modeling part. 

In the modeling part, the Naive Bayes algorithm is used to classify the financial news articles as positive, negative or neutral.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing techniques can be used to classify financial news articles as positive, negative or neutral. The project 

showcases how to preprocess the dataset and transform it into the required format for the modeling part. The results of this analysis can be used by investors to make 

data-driven decisions about buying or selling financial assets based on the sentiment of the financial news.
